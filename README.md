# Dungeon Helper

Addon for The Elder Scrolls Online MMORPG. Annotates in-game maps, adding locations and mechanical hints for bosses and puzzles.

## Features

Add icons to the map in all dungeons, arenas and trials, showing:

- Boss locations
- Locations of puzzles or other important points of interest

The tooltip for each boss gives brief "crib notes" on important mechanics. This includes any mechanics that are unique to Hard Mode.

Similarly, tooltips for puzzle icons give hints on how to complete the puzzle.

The icon for each boss has a different appearance depending on special characteristics of that boss:

- Normal boss: white
- Final boss: gold
- Secret boss: black
- "PUG Killer": red
